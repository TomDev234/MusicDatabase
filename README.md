(1, 'Abby Road', 'The Beatles', 1961, 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Beatles_-_Abbey_Road.jpg', 'Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It is the last album the group started recording,[2] although Let It Be was the last album completed before the band\'s break-up in April 1970.[3] It was mostly recorded in April, July and August 1969, and was released on 26 September 1969 in the United Kingdom, and 1 October 1969 in the United States, reaching number one in both countries. A double A-side single from the album, \"Something\" / \"Come Together\" was released in October, which also topped the charts in the US.\r\n\r\nAbbey Road incorporates styles such as rock, pop, blues, singer-songwriter, and progressive rock,[4] and makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer and guitar played through a Leslie speaker unit. It is also notable for having a long medley of songs on side two that have subsequently been covered as one suite by other notable artists. The album was recorded in a more collegial atmosphere than the Get Back / Let It Be sessions earlier in the year, but there were still significant confrontations within the band, particularly over Paul McCartney\'s song \"Maxwell\'s Silver Hammer\", and John Lennon did not perform on several tracks. By the time the album was released Lennon had left the group, though this was not publicly announced until McCartney also quit the following year.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was an immediate commercial success, it received mixed reviews. Some critics found its music inauthentic and criticised the production\'s artificial effects. By contrast, critics today view the album as one of the Beatles\' best and rank it as one of the greatest albums of all time. George Harrison\'s two songs on the album, \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\", have been regarded as among the best he wrote for the group. The album\'s cover, featuring the group walking across a zebra crossing outside Abbey Road Studios, has become one of the most famous and imitated in the history of recorded music. '),
(2, 'The Eminem Show', 'Eminem ', 2002, 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/35/The_Eminem_Show.jpg', 'The Eminem Show is the fourth studio album by American rapper Eminem. After it had originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002, the album was released nine days earlier on May 26, 2002, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records due to pirating and bootlegging of it. The album saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass. It features guest appearances from Obie Trice, D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Dina Rae and Eminem\'s daughter Hailie Jade Scott-Mathers.\r\n\r\nThe album incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem\'s previous albums, and its themes are predominantly based on Eminem\'s prominence in hip hop culture, as well as his ambivalent thoughts of fame. The album also features political commentary on the United States, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the War on terror, President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, The Eminem Show was regarded as Eminem\'s most personal album at the time and a step back from the Slim Shady alter ego.\r\n\r\nWidely considered the most anticipated album of 2002, The Eminem Show debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and stood there for six non-consecutive weeks. It sold over 1.3 million copies in its second week in the US, where it registered a full week of sales. It also topped the UK Albums Chart for five consecutive weeks. It produced four commercially successful singles, \"Without Me\", \"Cleanin\' Out My Closet\", \"Superman\", and \"Sing for the Moment\", and it features one of his most popular songs, \"\'Till I Collapse\". The album was met with positive critical reviews, with praise directed at Eminem\'s mature, introspective lyricism and the album\'s experimental production.\r\n\r\nThe Eminem Show was both the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States and the best-selling album worldwide of 2002, along with being the best-selling hip hop album in music history, and Eminem’s most commercially successful album to date. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its worldwide sales of 27 million copies make it one of the best-selling albums of all time and the second best-selling album of the 21st century. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album, while \"Without Me\" won Best Music Video. Blender, Muzik and LAUNCH named it the best album of 2002, and several publications named it among the best albums of the 2000s decade. '),
(3, 'Hybrid Theory', 'Linkin Park', 2000, 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/Linkin_Park_Hybrid_Theory_Album_Cover.jpg', 'Hybrid Theory is the debut studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on October 24, 2000, through Warner Bros. Records. Recorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don Gilmore, the album\'s lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and divorce of his parents. Hybrid Theory takes its title from the previous name of the band as well as the concept of music theory and combining different styles. This is also the only album on which bassist Dave Farrell does not play.\r\n\r\nFour singles were released from Hybrid Theory: \"One Step Closer\", \"In the End\", \"Crawling\" and \"Papercut\", all of them being responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. While \"In the End\" was the most successful of the four, all of the singles in the album remain some of the band\'s most successful songs to date. Although \"Runaway\", \"Points of Authority\", and \"My December\" from the special edition bonus disc album were not released as singles, they were minor hits on alternative rock radio stations thanks to the success of all of the band\'s singles and the album; \"Runaway\" has also made several appearances on radio stations.\r\n\r\nGenerally receiving positive reviews from critics upon its release, Hybrid Theory became a strong commercial success.[8] Peaking at number two on the US Billboard 200, it is certified 12× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also reached the top 10 in 15 other countries and has sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling debut album since Guns N\' Roses\'s Appetite for Destruction (1987) and the best-selling rock album of the 21st century.[9] At the 44th Grammy Awards, it won Best Hard Rock Performance for \"Crawling\".\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Linkin Park released the remix album Reanimation. It included the songs of Hybrid Theory remixed and reinterpreted by nu metal and underground hip hop artists.[10] Contributors to the album included Black Thought, Pharoahe Monch, Jonathan Davis, Stephen Carpenter, and Aaron Lewis. The sound of later Linkin Park albums would involve experimentation with classical instruments such as strings and piano, both of which, along with the same elements of electronica from Hybrid Theory, are prominently included in the band\'s second studio album, Meteora.[11]\r\n\r\nOn August 13, 2020, Warner Records announced a re-release of Hybrid Theory for its 20th anniversary.[12][13] A previously unreleased demo song, \"She Couldn\'t\", was put out at the same time.[12] '),
(4, 'Recovery', 'Eminem ', 2010, 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/60/Recovery_Album_Cover.jpg', 'Recovery (stylized as RECOVƎRY) is the seventh studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on June 18, 2010, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. The album serves as a direct follow-up to Relapse (2009). Production of the album took place during 2009 to 2010 at several recording studios and was handled by various record producers, including Alex da Kid, Just Blaze, Boi-1da, Jim Jonsin, DJ Khalil, Mr. Porter, and Dr. Dre. Eminem also collaborated with artists such as Pink, Lil Wayne, Rihanna, and Slaughterhouse for the album.\r\n\r\nRecovery featured more introspective and emotional content than its predecessor and the theme of the album revolved around his positive changes, anxiety, and emotional drives. To promote it, Eminem performed the album\'s songs on televised shows, at award ceremonies, and musical events; he also headed The Recovery Tour.\r\n\r\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 741,000 copies.[3] It also reached number one in 16 other countries. It spawned four singles: \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"No Love\", and \"Space Bound\", with the former two both reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Recovery was the best-selling album worldwide in 2010 and the best-selling album in the US in 2010. The album received generally positive reviews by critics and was widely regarded as an improvement to Relapse.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, Recovery was certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), becoming Eminem\'s third best-selling studio album behind The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002).[4] At the 2011 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year; the latter two were for \"Love the Way You Lie\". The album earned Eminem American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, among other awards '),
(5, 'Rumours', 'Fleetwood Mac', 1977, 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/FMacRumours.PNG', 'Rumours is the eleventh studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records. Largely recorded in California in 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. The recording sessions took place in the aftermath of several relationship breakups among its members in addition to heavy drug use, both of which shaped the album\'s direction and lyrics.\r\n\r\nRecorded with the intention of making \"a pop album\" that would expand on the commercial success of their self-titled 1975 album, the music of Rumours is characterized by a mix of electric and acoustic instrumentation, accented rhythms, guitars, and keyboards, while its lyrics concern personal and often troubled relationships. Its release was postponed by delays in the mixing process. Following the album\'s release, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide concert tours. Rumours became the band\'s first number-one album on the UK Albums Chart and also topped the US Billboard 200. The songs \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Dreams\", \"Don\'t Stop\", and \"You Make Loving Fun\" were released as singles, all of which reached the US top 10, with \"Dreams\" reaching number one.\r\n\r\nRumours was an instant commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide within just a month of its release. It garnered widespread acclaim from critics, with praise centred on its production quality and vocal harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among the band’s three vocalists, and has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. It won Album of the Year at the 1978 Grammy Awards and received Diamond certifications in several countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, and the US, where it was certified 20× Platinum. As of February 2023, Rumours has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the sixth best-selling album of the 1970s, and the 12th best-selling album of all time.[1]\r\n\r\nOften considered Fleetwood Mac\'s magnum opus, Rumours has frequently been cited as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2003, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[2] In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of \"Silver Springs\", which had been excluded from the original release, and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress.[3] In 2020, Rumours was rated the seventh-greatest album of all time in Rolling Stone\'s list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".[4] '),
